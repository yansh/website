<div style="text-align: justify">  Yan received his Ph.D. in Engineering from
the University of Sydney, Australia. His research focuses on people-centered
privacy design which calls for the adoption of a socially meaningful conception
of privacy, namely, one that meets people's expectation of privacy. His work
aims to address the fundamental mismatch between programmable privacy frameworks
and the ever-shifting privacy expectations of computer system users.
